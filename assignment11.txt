What is a function in PHP?
A PHP function feature is a piece of code that can be used over and over again and accepts argument lists as input, and returns  value.

Ten examples of in-built functions in PHP.
echo(); outputs text or variables to the screen.
print();outputs text or variables to the screen.
strlen(); returns the length of a string.
substr();returns a potion of a string.
array-merge(); merges two or more arrays into one.
count(); returns the number of elements in an array.
sort(); sorts an array in ascending order.
rand();generates a random integer within a specified range.
implode();joins an array into a string based on a delimiter.
explode();splits a string into an array based on  delimiter. 

Differentiate between in-built functions and customised functions.
In-built PHP functions are predefined, general-purpose and optimized
while
Customised functions are user-defined, specific purpose and require additional code
